# üö® cPanel MIME Type Debugging Guide

## The Exact Problem
Your browser error confirms the issue:
```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream"
```

**Translation**: Your cPanel server is serving JavaScript files with the wrong MIME type (`application/octet-stream` instead of `text/javascript` or `application/javascript`).

## Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Build and Upload
```bash
npm run build
```

Upload **ALL** files from the `dist/` folder to your `public_html/` directory, including the new `.htaccess` file.

### Step 2: Verify MIME Type Fix
1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12)
2. **Go to Network tab**
3. **Refresh the page**
4. **Find a JavaScript file** (usually `main-[hash].js`)
5. **Click on it and check Response Headers**

**‚úÖ SUCCESS**: Should show `Content-Type: text/javascript`
**‚ùå FAILURE**: Still shows `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`

### Step 3: If Still Failing

#### Option A: Alternative .htaccess
If the enhanced version doesn't work, try this minimal approach:

```apache
# Minimal MIME fix
<IfModule mod_mime.c>
    RemoveType .js
    AddType text/javascript .js
</IfModule>

<FilesMatch "\.js$">
    ForceType text/javascript
</FilesMatch>

<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    <FilesMatch "\.js$">
        Header set Content-Type "text/javascript"
    </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>

# React routing
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule ^(?!assets/).*$ /index.html [L]
```

#### Option B: Contact Hosting Support
Use this exact message:

> **Subject**: JavaScript MIME Type Configuration Required
> 
> **Message**: 
> I'm deploying a React application that uses ES modules. The server is currently serving .js files with MIME type "application/octet-stream" which causes this browser error:
> 
> "Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of 'application/octet-stream'"
> 
> Please configure the server to serve .js files with MIME type "text/javascript" or "application/javascript".
> 
> Can you also confirm that mod_mime and mod_headers modules are enabled for my account?

#### Option C: Test with Simple JavaScript
Create a test file to isolate the issue:

```html
<!-- test.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>MIME Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Testing JavaScript MIME Type</h1>
    <script type="module">
        console.log('ES module loaded successfully!');
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

If this simple test fails with the same error, it's definitely a server configuration issue.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `.htaccess` file uploaded to root directory
- [ ] File permissions: 644 for files, 755 for directories  
- [ ] JavaScript files showing `Content-Type: text/javascript` in Network tab
- [ ] No console errors about MIME types
- [ ] React app loads successfully

## Alternative Solutions

If cPanel continues to have issues:

1. **Netlify**: Upload your `dist` folder - automatic React support
2. **Vercel**: Connect your GitHub repo - zero configuration
3. **GitHub Pages**: Free static hosting with proper MIME types
4. **Firebase Hosting**: Google's reliable static hosting

## Debug Commands

Check what's actually being served:
```bash
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/assets/main-[hash].js
```

Look for the `Content-Type` header in the response.

This enhanced fix should resolve the MIME type issue! üéØ
